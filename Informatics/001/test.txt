The World needs to work together in AI Just like 
we have a World Trade Organisation for trade, a World 
Health Organisation for health, we need to establish 
cross border collaborations just like the WTO and WHO. 
Call it a World Data Organisation, whose prime focus is the 
establishment of rules and regulations around AI and automation. 
We need logicians, computer scientists, ethics professors, 
politicians and other legislators to sit down and draw up a 
Declaration of AI, signed and agreed upon by all the world’s 
greatest players in the field of AI and automation. And we need 
corporations on board too. This collaboration is already evident 
among corporations that are now openly sharing advances in AI with 
their competitors, but it needs to happen on a global scale, and quick. 
As with mitigating disaster when jobs start falling away in troves, 
it is always good to be prepared BEFORE the event happens. I for one, 
am extremely optimistic about the outcome, just like the pioneers
 of AI research in Dartmouth, I too believe that robots, machines, 
computers, AI and automation will be a heaven send for our planet 
(think about what an AI algorithm could about climate change or ocean 
pollution when it puts its “mind” to the task? We could achieve incredible 
results and create a happier, more fulfilled workforce in the process, 
turning factories, traditionally labelled as not very nice places to work in, 
into places of fulfillment and joy, where every worker actually increases 
their productivity, because, for once, they are happy!
